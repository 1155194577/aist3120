Happiness is a subjective state of mind influenced by a multitude of factors, including socio-economic conditions, environmental influences, and personal experiences. Due to the complexity of human emotions, researchers often rely on qualitative research methods, such as interviews and focus groups, to explore individual perspectives. However, qualitative research alone may not always lead to universally convincing conclusions. With the advent of Data Science, researchers now have access to advanced tools and techniques that enable the analysis of large-scale datasets. This integration of qualitative insights with quantitative data allows for a more comprehensive understanding of happiness, bridging the gap between subjective experiences and measurable patterns.


captured the attention of psychologists, sociologists, and data scientists alike. By combining traditional qualitative approaches with modern quantitative methods, we aim to uncover actionable insights into the factors that contribute to happiness. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances our understanding but also provides a foundation for developing strategies to improve well-being on both individual and societal levels.
